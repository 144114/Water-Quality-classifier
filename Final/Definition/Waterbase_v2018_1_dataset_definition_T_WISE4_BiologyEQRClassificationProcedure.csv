parameterNaturalAWBHMWB,"Specification of whether a water body is identified as natural, artificial (AWB) or heavily modified (HMWB). AWBs are surface water bodies which have been created in a location where no water body existed before and which have not been created by the direct physical alteration, movement or realignment of an existing water body. HMWB are bodies of water which as a result of physical alterations by human activity are substantially changed in character and cannot, therefore, meet ""good ecological status"" (GES). In this context physical alterations mean changes to e.g. the size, slope, discharge, form and shape of river bed of a water body.","AWB: Artificial water body;
HMWB:  Heavily modified water body;
Natural:  Natural water body"
